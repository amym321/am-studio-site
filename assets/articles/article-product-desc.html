                 <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Writing Product Descriptions That Sell</h3>
                 <p class="single-blog">
                  When it comes to your online store, your product descriptions are your opportunity to make a connection with your 
                  customer. A good product description should supply customers with important information about the features 
                  and benefits of the product so that they’re compelled to buy. 
                 </p>     
                 <p class="single-blog">
                  A big mistake you can make is to do no more than simply describe your product. Great marketing copy should 
                  entice and persuade your customer. Let's look at some key ways to write great product descriptions and get out
                  of the trap of writing too blunt or simple product descriptions.
                 </p>  
                 <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Know Your Target Customer</h3>
                 <p class="single-blog">
                  Writing compelling content starts with knowing who you are trying to persuade to buy. Promoting products
                  to athletic minded college kids will differ a great deal from to selling to first time moms, for example.
                  Take what you know about your target audience and write with their interests and lifestyles in mind.
                </p>
                <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Emphasize Your Products’ Biggest Benefits</h3>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  As the seller, you are excited about your products and their details and specifications.
                  It's understandable that you want to show your 
                  customers that you did a really good job making or sourcing your products. 
                  Yet, most customers aren't too
                  interested in a long list of features and specs. Too often they get bored and lose 
                  interest quickly.
                </p>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  Write instead with the perspective of how your product will address your customers' needs and desires.
                  Consider the benefit of each of your features.
                  Think of highlighting the benefit of each feature and tell your customers how happy, healthy, or more 
                  productive they will be after they buy it.
                  Ideally, you want to address which problems and inconveniences your product help solve.
                </p>
                <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Avoid Cliches</h3>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  When you start writing your ecommerce product descriptions, you need a rich vocabulary and a lot of 
                  inspiration. However, there can be also moments when you feel stuck and you might use bland descriptions 
                  like “top-quality product”. An unoriginal cliche like that will leave your customer thinking that your 
                  product is like all the rest.
                </p>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  In order to avoid a lackluster reaction from your customer, you should be as specific as possible. 
                  Rather than using hackneyed and boring descriptions of your products, you should describe each 
                  technical detail along with its benefit. Talking about product details adds credibility.  
                </p>  
                <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Use Storytelling</h3>
                <br>
                <img class="project-img " src="../images/articles/productDescription18.jpg" width="900" alt="Product description">
                <br><br>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  Does your product or brand have a backstory that’s particularly special to you? Chances are it will be particularly 
                  special and endearing to your audience too. Use that story in your product description to add more 
                  character to your items. You're engaging your audience and winning hearts and minds.  
                </p>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  You can add your story after your benefits description so that the customer can choose to read further or not.
                  When it comes to telling a story about your products, ask yourself:
                </p>
                <p class="single-blog indent">
                  • Who made the product?<br>
                  • What inspired them to make the product?<br>
                  • What obstacles did they overcome on the way?<br>
                </p>
                <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Use Social Proof</h3>
                <br>
                <img class="project-img " src="../images/articles/productDescription17b.jpg" width="500" alt="Product description">
                <br><br>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  Your online visitors might feel a bit insecure whether you are a 
                  legitimate and professional seller or not, particularly if you are new on the market.
                  These customers are likely to search for                   
                  suggestions or recommendations to check whether your products are really as you describe them to be. 
                  Your customers are much more likely to close the deal when a product has a high number of positive reviews.                     
                </p> 
                <br> 
                <img class="project-img " src="../images/articles/SocialProofb.jpg" width="700" alt="Product description">
                <br><br>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  By including personal reviews of your previous customers in the ecommerce product description, you will 
                  add more credibility to your brand and establish a more personal connection with your buyers.  
                  If you have had your products reviewed and featured by someone reputable, you can really add to the
                  trust-worthiness factor.
                </p>
                <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Make Your Description Scannable To The Eye</h3>
                <br>
                <img class="project-img " src="../images/articles/productDescription13b.jpg" width="700" alt="Product description">
                <br><br>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  Lastly, make sure that your product page design is encouraging visitors to read what you have.
                  Presenting your product descriptions with a clear, scannable design makes them easier to read 
                  and more appealing to potential customers.  
                </p> 
                <p class="single-blog">
                  Here are some tips that you can use to make your product descriptions more visually appealing 
                  to your customers, and can be seen in the image above:
                </p>
                <p class="single-blog indent">
                  • Entice your web visitor with headlines<br>
                  • Use easy-to-scan bullet points<br>
                  • Include plenty of white space<br>
                  • Increase your font size to promote readability
                </p>
                <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Conclusion</h3>

                   In eCommerce, product descriptions are the best form of communication you have with your customers to get them to buy. 
                   Therefore, you should know who your target audience is and personalize your content in such a way to speak 
                   “their language”. A good product description will change the way they think about your product and they 
                   will become more open to trying it.
