                <p class="single-blog">
                  Fox and Raven Jewelry is a brand that has been selling successfully on Etsy and was primed for further 
                  sales channels. The client inquired about Shopify and I
                  highlighted the ease of the platform, the embedded security,
                  and the depth of functionality available for small businesses with plugins.
                 </p>
                 <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Client Requested Customization</h3><br>
                 <p class="single-blog">
                  The client had additional functionality they wanted that was not available "out of the box" in the 
                  theme that they chose. In particular, they were accustomed to customers 
                  requesting unique modifications to their handmade jewelry pieces. These modifications couldnâ€™t be added 
                  as variants to the products since every modification was unique and the price would be determined based 
                  on the unique request.
                 </p>
                 <p class="single-blog">
                  I offered the client a couple options with which to add this functionality and they settled on adding a 
                  "Modification Request" button
                  on the product page whereby the customer would be directed to a form to send their desired 
                  modification details. 
                </p>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  Once a modification was discussed at length with my client, the customer would receive
                  an approval code. I created an "Modification" input field on the product page where the customer 
                  could enter the approval code. This modification code gets carried over to the cart and  
                  eventually the order, alerting the jeweler of the modification after checkout.
                  I coded in the functionality of the Modification Code Input Field as well as the Modification 
                  Request button.
                 </p>

                 <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Additional Customization</h3><br>
                 <p class="single-blog">
                  I added a new section to the theme for the client to provide a little more flexibility in 
                  the design. I created an Image With Text In Box section and specifically added a color 
                  picker to the Theme Editor for the client. The client is now able to add color to the background 
                  of the text.

                 <div class=" text-center">
                   <img class="project-img " src="../images/caseStudy/editor1.jpg" width="200" alt="Article">                
                 <br><br>

                 <h3 class="service-title2" ><br>Customization Replicating Apps</h3><br>
                 <p class="single-blog">
                  I added customization replicating apps so that the client would save monthly fees as well as have
                  a faster store than would otherwise be the case if using apps. Often, apps slow a site just a little bit
                  because the site has to go to other servers to get the code of the integrated apps. This adversely 
                  affects the website's Search Engine Optimization and thus the Google Ranking.
                 </p>
                 <p class="single-blog">
                  The client requested a gift-wrapping option for the store since they were used to this on the Etsy site. 
                  I added this functionality as an option for customers on the cart. It updates the cart by adding the gift 
                  wrapping and associated cost to the order. 
                </p>
                <p class="single-blog">
                  I also added a second image on hover for all products showing on the collection pages. This provided
                  a better design for the store. 
                  Finally, I automatically squared all of the product images showing on the collection pages. The client
                  was very happy to not have to upload perfectly squared product images now that the site did it for them. 
                 </p>
